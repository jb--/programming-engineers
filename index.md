## Managers get people to do something.

- As an engineering manager, my job is to "program engineers"

## Why this page?

- There is loads of good books out there that tell people about how to manage people
- I wanted to write up what I consider important for my past self... 

## Communication to non-techies

- As engineering manager my key job is to ensure that my team reaches the business goal.

## Running Projects

- As an engineering manager a relevant chunk of the job is to run and execute projects
- Ensure that there are quick-save points in your project

## Solve problems

- Consider speaking about options mutually exclusive completely exhaustive

## Spread a vision

- Don't tell your team how to build it, but tell them what the goal is that you want to do

## Be interested in people

- Be really honestly curious about what your team thinks. 
- [Ted Talk about communication](https://www.ted.com/talks/celeste_headlee_10_ways_to_have_a_better_conversation)

## Ensure that you're understood

- Ask questions like: "Did you get this?" "Does this make sense?"

## Ensure that your software is easy

> Gute Software muss stumpf sein

## Take decisions and be able to defend them 

- Make sure that there are two points to every decision you are taking.

## Take your time

- Sometimes the most burning urgent issues are actually not. 
- Take a step back, relax and ask for how urgent it is.
- If it's not urgent take your time
- If you take time and the problem resolved itself, you did a good job

## Keep the interfaces untouched - if you can

- Working in a single team is easy, working across teams is hard


## Good architecture is not an argument

- It never is, what is though, is the underlying reasons behind it
- You built a system that is now more performant in resource consumption and response times. The attributed business value is 5kâ‚¬/month for the infra and no user impact on the response times. At the same time the change entails other costs like: More maintainenace, more difficult to understand, ... whatever. No good change.


## Think for the other teams

- unhappy stakeholders can impact your team's happiness. Watch out that you get things covered

## Think about the big picture

- How would you build it if it was all yours? You were to run the show and be responsible? Is it still in your area? In someone elses? 
- Try to avoid: "Well we work with Java that's why we build this thing with Java, where a simple MySQL query would have done the job."

## Prepare for the storm

- If you can, and you know that the ship will be going through a storm, take precautions beforehand and prepare for the things that are important.

## Don't take yourself too serious

- Rather take a step back in the career ladder, rather risk your profile, if it serves the company. 
- There's two teams, with two team leads, and you know it should be only one team? Push for it, make it happen. Do not care about your spot. Do not clinge to two teams, if it should be one, just because you want to save your own position. You would find a slot somewhere. 

## Be cautious of the steps ahead

- You're an engineering lead? Make sure that you can still do engineering. If you're too long out, then you might become the kind of manager you never wanted to have. 

## Defend your people

- Your team depends on you to protect them from the outside 


## Spread ideas in small circles

- You want to get an idea through? Take the time and first check in with individuals, then discuss with the team to ensure you're aligned, then take it to a bigger group. 
- Nothing sucks more than proposing an idea in front of a big group and the attacks come from within your own rows. 
- In these cases, you are representing your team, not yourself. 

## How to build great teams

- Read tribal leadership 
- Work with an individuals to get them like the job
- Connect two indivdiuals to make sure that they are having bonds
- Connect several groups of individuals to make sure that the team is a team


## Ensure that your team is a team 
- In a team, everyone should be able to work on all components.
- If you have a single person being the only one to work on something? 
- Buzz factor of that person leaving
- Team impact, worse quality.


## Believe in the best of others

- There might be different teams that do things differently than you would
- Your prime thought should be that whatever they are doing, they are doing it with the best intentions. 


## Praise your team

- If you see an opportunitiy to give public praise to your team go for it!

## Be cautious with critical feedback

- If your team member annoys you, be cautious with showing it

## Do situational leadership

- Not every team member needs the same input at the same time.
